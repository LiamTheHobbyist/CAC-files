# CAC-files
files to make the CAC

SOFTWARE
joytokey (look it up)
a slicer of your choice

PARTS LIST 
all the 3d printed parts 
and this hardware 25$ https://www.amazon.com/Buttons-EG-STARTS-Joystick-Raspberry/dp/B01M2X88QP/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3LJ6ZNSBIR75D&keywords=arcade+buttons&qid=1701916898&sprefix=arcade+bu%2Caps%2C191&sr=8-7
super glue (any brand will do)
rough sandpaper (only needed if mounting the joystick permently but good to have for the case)
painters tape (only needed for the not permanent solution)
zip ties (optional for wiring)

HOW TO MAKE IT

1. print out all the files and place the top down in your slicer (the one with the 6 holes or the one with the one smaller hole) for improved surface finish 

2. once you are done with that start gluing the 2 main body pieces and the 2 lid pieces of the base APART FROM EACH OTHER and I would recommend using popsicle sticks on the connecting sides to inprove strength and also make sure you put the USB cable into the ole as you close it causes it won't go trough after closing

3. once you connect both the bottom and the top we can start putting in the hardware

MOUNTING THE JOYSTICK

there are 2 ways of doing it one is PERMANENT and the other is not so if you want to use the parts again use the 2nd one

1ST PERMANENT sand the metal of the joystick without the ball and you don't need to sand too much (I would plug it in to the board and plug it into your pc make sure it's the right way up the 2 big holes should be facing you use joy to key to do this) then stick it on use activator if you want to make sure is lined up horizontally wait for the glue to fully dry then continue to button placement

2ND not permanent put painter's tape on the joystick where you want to glue it (I would plug it into the board and plug it into your pc make sure its the right way up the 2 big holes should be facing you use joy to key to do this) then stick it on use activator if you want make sure is lined up horizontally wait for glue to fully dry then continue to button placement

BUTTON PLACEMENT, WIRING, AND FINISHING

start by screwing in all the buttons using the included washers using whatever colors you want and then insert all of the wires in to the buttons ports (optional zip-tie the 6 main button wires together and the pinball buttons together and also the start and player one buttons together) now plug everything into the board then plug in the board plug it into the PC then test on joytokey if all the buttons work then you can close it up with super glue with the bottom lid that you glued.

and you are done use joy to key to set keyboard controlls to each of the movements and have fun playing games on your new device
